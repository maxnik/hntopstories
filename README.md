Hacker News top stories
=======================

View the top 40 Hacker News stories for a single day judging by the points. 

My first attempt to create a 30,000 foot view kind of reader for Hacker News was 
[Over100points](https://github.com/maxnik/over100points) toy app. But the API provider 
for it annonced they were going to shut down the service, so I decided to migrate to a 
new API run by [Algolia](http://hn.algolia.com/api). Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't 
figure out how to replicate the functionality of the old reader in the new API, so I 
tried to create similar user experience in a new weekend app.
